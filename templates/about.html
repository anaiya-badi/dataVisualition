  <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1> 

  <p>This is a data visualization project aiming to show common targets of suicide bombers in different countries.</p>

  <p>Suicide bombing is an attack carried out by someone who intends to kill other people along with themselves with a kind of bomb.</p>


  <h3>Prototypes</h3>

  <h3>Feedback</h3> 
  <p>I think for the micro page (is it the map?) it would be helpful to have a summary of each different crime, location, people affected, weapon used, etc. in sentence form using Jinja so we can see the exact numbers for that year.</p>
  
  <p>There's a lot of data so it's a little unclear. I think all the settings for the map could be in one place on the map. I think the author should narrow down the settings the user chooses from and pick one central message. The graph's hover function seems like it would be a little different to read, especially if there's so many countries--i suggest the author changes that. Definitely pick one or two big ideas to emphasize. Also add color and make the font bigger. It's a little unclear how the map works also.</p>
  
  <p> dropdown instead of slider for year</br>
    label each country on line graph always instead of only onhover </p>

  <h3>Take-aways</h3> 
  <p>Focus data for less noise, I'll focus on targets by location. This will also allow for bar graphs by year with one all years average one instead of the noisy line chart. The select bubble on the svg will also now include a dynamically generated sentance summary instead of a bunch of numbers together.</p>
